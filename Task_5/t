🚀 Thrilled to share insights from my final task at Prodigy Internship! This project focused on identifying features influencing accident reports, harnessing the power of automation to streamline the analysis process. 🚗💥

🛠️ Leveraging my automated coding skills, I optimized efficiency by reusing and adapting previous codes. From loading the dataset to preprocessing, separating columns, feature selection, generating box plots, removing outliers, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), each step was seamlessly integrated for a comprehensive analysis.

💻 By automating these processes, I ensured consistency and reproducibility in my analyses while saving valuable time. This approach not only facilitates a deeper exploration of the data but also empowers me to tackle complex tasks with ease.

📊 Through techniques like box plots and EDA, I uncovered valuable insights into the factors contributing to accidents. These insights pave the way for informed decision-making and proactive measures to enhance safety.

🌟 Grateful for the opportunity to apply my skills and learn in a supportive environment at Prodigy Internship. Excited to carry forward these experiences as I continue my journey in the field of data science! #FeatureAnalysis #Automation #DataScience #InternshipJourney
